TO INSTALL:
-----------
First make sure that taglib and file (libmagic) are installed.
If they are not, download them here:
	- http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib/
	- ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/
and then build and install them.

Use "make" to build id3ted, and then install it by running "make install"
with root priveleges.

The default prefix for the installation is /usr/local. So id3ted is installed
in /usr/local/bin. You can install it in any other directory by specifying
your own prefix:
    type "make PREFIX=/your/install/path install" as root

Linux users should use the "Makefile.linux" instead of the default "Makefile".
Mac OS X users should use the "Makefile.macosx".

Please make sure that the CXXFLAGS variable contains -I entries for the
include directories of taglib and file. The LDFLAGS variable has to contain
-L entries for the lib directories of taglib and file.
(see the gcc manpage for more details)

After the installation you can type "id3ted --help" for getting information
on how to use it.

PREPROCESSOR VARIABLES:
-----------------------
The following preprocessor variables are used to control the build process of
id3ted. You can define them by adding -D entries to the CXXFLAGS variable.
(see the gcc manpage for more details)

NO_STR_BASENAME: Use own implementation of the basename function.
Required if your C string library does not contain it.

DISABLE_UTF8: Prevent id3ted from using UTF-8 as the default encoding for
filenames and id3 tags. Useful if your system did not support or use UTF-8.
