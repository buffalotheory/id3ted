BUILDING
--------
First make sure that taglib and file (libmagic) are installed.
Otherwise, check if your system offers binary and devel packages for them.
If it does not, download them here:
    http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib/
    ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/
and then build and install them.

Use the following commands to build and install id3ted:

    $ make
		# make install

Please notice, that the second command needs root priveleges.

The default prefix for the installation is /usr/local. Replace the second
command with the following, to use a directory of your choice:

    # make PREFIX=/your/install/path install

The default Makefile should work on almost any *NIX system. There is also
an alternative Makefile for Darwin & Mac OS X: Makefile.darwin.
This one also looks into the installation directories of the two most common
port systems -- MacPorts and Fink -- when looking for TagLib and File/Magic.

Please make sure that the CXXFLAGS variable contains "-I" entries for the
include directories of taglib and file. The LDFLAGS variable has to contain
"-L" entries for the lib directories of taglib and file.
Please have a look at the gcc manpage for more details.

After the installation you can type "id3ted --help" for getting information
on how to use it.

PREPROCESSOR VARIABLES
----------------------
The following preprocessor variables are used to control the build process of
id3ted. You can define them by adding -D entries to the CXXFLAGS variable.
Please have a look at the gcc manpage for more details.

NO_STR_BASENAME: Use own implementation of the basename function.
Required if your C string library does not contain it.

DISABLE_UTF8: Prevent id3ted from using UTF-8 as the default encoding for
filenames and id3 tags. Useful if your system does not support or use UTF-8.
