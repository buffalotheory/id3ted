   ones, cutting off their additional information (picture data, description
   fields, etc.) 

id3ted v0.6.1 -- September 24, 2009
 * New options: -n/-N, parse filepaths using given pattern with wildcards and
   apply the matches for these wildcards to their corresponding tag frames.
   Both options act the same, except that the pattern of -N is interpreted as
   an extended regular expression

   original path after moving them

id3ted v0.6 -- March 27, 2009

   reside on the same filesystem

   by an invalid wildcard
 * Improved support for building id3ted on common linux distributions

   ability to replace wildcards in that pattern with information found in the
   tags. For instance, you can move some files to %a/%t.mp3 with %a as a
   placeholder for the artist information and %t for the title.

id3ted v0.4 -- April 15, 2008
 * Completely rewritten
 * Using TagLib as the new base instead of id3lib, because it is not so
   buggy and it supports version 2.4 tags

 * Support for TSOA, TSOP and TSOT frames in v2.3 tag
 * Bug fix: not ignoring the version 1 tag anymore when setting the
   comment information

 * Check only for the minimal permissions on the files, regarding the 
   options given on the command line. Do not check for write permission
   (and abort if not granted) anymore, not regarding that id3ted only needs
   to read the files.

   -2 and -3 options in a slightly better way

id3ted v0.2 -- October 14, 2007
 * New option: -d to set the delimiter used to distinguish the components
   of a multiple field option argument. This is helpful if for instance the
   description for the new comment contains a ':'.

 * Initial release
 * Based on id3v2 by Myers Carpenter
